### Description:
Built a weather applicaion that shows your current location.

Goal of the project: It was meant to show people their location and what the weather is like. It uses an API that shows the information in their local area.

Stack used: HTMl5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6

There are some changes needed as the project is still incomplete. For example, if a user is looking at the app during the night then it should change the background to dark.
