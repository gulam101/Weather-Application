### Description:
This project was created so that I can put everything I learnt in JavaScript. I also practised on using API's in JavaScript so that I had a understanding of how they worked. In this project the user can see their local weather in their current location and this helps them when they want to quickly know the weather. Built a weather applicaion that shows your current location.

Goal of the project: It was meant to show people their location and what the weather is like. It uses an API that shows the information in their local area.

There are some changes needed as the project is still incomplete. For example, if a user is looking at the app during the night then it should change the background to dark.

Languages: 
- HTML5 
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
