### Description:
Built a weather applicaion that shows your current location.

Goal of the project: It was meant to show people their location and what the weather is like. It uses an API that shows the information in their local area.

There are some changes needed as the project is still incomplete. For example, if a user is looking at the app during the night then it should change the background to dark.

Stack: HTMl5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6

What I Learnt:
- Better undestanding of HTML
- Better understanding of CSS
- Variables in JavaScript
- API testing using JavaScript
- Getting comftable using Atom
